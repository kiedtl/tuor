Tuor
====

Tuor is a basic Gemini client for Varvara, written in Finwë. It was created to
demonstrate Finwë's `Net` device extension.

Building
--------

You will need `Finwë` installed.

    $ finwe src/main.finw -x tuor.rom

Limitations
-----------

* Tuor, being a Varvara ROM, is memory-constrained and will fail to load large
  webpages.
* No multi-tab support.
* No automatic redirections.
* Errors may not be displayed properly.
* Client certifications and user input are not supported.
* No support for Gopher.

All this will *eventually* be worked on (see the TODO). For now, the priority is
to polish the `Net` device and work on the shortcomings in Finwë which Tuor has
surfaced.
