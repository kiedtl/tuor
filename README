Tuor
====

Tuor is a small Gemini client for Varvara, written in Finwë. It was created to
demonstrate Finwë's `Net` device extension.

Currently it lacks many basic features, but the plan it to eventually polish it
into one worth using.

Usage
-----

You will need `Finwë` installed.

    $ finwe -g src/main.finw

You can create a standalone ROM with with Finwë's `-x` flag, but that'll require
an emulator that supports the `Net` device. As of now, only Finwë's builtin
emulator has this feature.

Limitations
-----------

* No mouse support, at all.
* Tuor, being a Varvara ROM, is memory-constrained and will fail to load large
  webpages. (Currently the limit is quite low, since the ROM is stuffed with
  useless fonts.)
* No multiple tabs.
* No automatic redirections.
* Client certifications is not supported.
* User input is not supported.
* No support for Gopher. (Yes, all serious Gemini clients should include some
  basic Gopher abilities.)

All this will *eventually* be worked on (see the TODO). For now, the priority is
to polish the `Net` device and work on the shortcomings in Finwë which Tuor has
surfaced (rg 'TODO: Finwe:' src).
